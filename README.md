# Overview
- The purpose of this repository was to hold the files for the mentee to access easily. The mentorship is multifaceted; however, one key aspect is understanding how Python can be applied in general and in the context of quantitative finance. Moreover, fundamental concepts in quantitative finance are demonstrated through Jupyter notebooks.

# Lessons
- [**#1.1: Python**](https://github.com/henrycosentino/quant_mentorship/blob/main/Lessons/1.1_python.ipynb): A lesson focusing on the fundamentals of Python and object-oriented programming.
- [**#1.2: Python**](https://github.com/henrycosentino/quant_mentorship/blob/main/Lessons/1.2_python.ipynb): A lesson that focuses on iteration, with applications to functions (KNN algorithm) that can be implemented iteratively.
- [**#1.3: Python**](https://github.com/henrycosentino/quant_mentorship/blob/main/Lessons/1.3_python.ipynb): A lesson focusing on the fundamentals of classes in Python, with applications to Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithm implementation using Pythons class structure.
- [**#1.4: Python**](https://github.com/henrycosentino/quant_mentorship/blob/main/Lessons/1.4_python.ipynb): A lesson on lambda function, function arguments, higher order functions, and decorators.
- [**#1.5: Python**](https://github.com/henrycosentino/quant_mentorship/blob/main/Lessons/1.5_python.ipynb): A mini lesson on threading and the concurrent.futures library in Python.
- [**#2.1: Fixed Income**](https://github.com/henrycosentino/quant_mentorship/blob/main/Lessons/2.1_fixed_income.ipynb): The first section of the analysis of fixed income securities. Covering topics involving the pricing structures of bonds, duration, convexity, yield-to-maturity, spot rates, and forward rates.
- [**#2.2: Fixed Income**](https://github.com/henrycosentino/quant_mentorship/blob/main/Lessons/2.2_fixed_income.ipynb): The second section of the analysis of fixed income securities. The lesson focuses on bonds with options, such as mortgages and callable bonds, and discusses the implications an option has on calculating duration, convexity, and spread.
- [**#2.3: Fixed Income**](https://github.com/henrycosentino/quant_mentorship/blob/main/Lessons/2.3_fixed_income.ipynb): The final section of the analysis of fixed income securities. The lesson focuses on future and swap interest rate products.
- [**#3.1: Options**](https://github.com/henrycosentino/quant_mentorship/blob/main/Lessons/3.1_options.ipynb): **TBD** The first section on financial options, which covers the pricing of interest rate future options and swaptions.
- [**#3.2: Options**](https://github.com/henrycosentino/quant_mentorship/blob/main/Lessons/3.2_options.ipynb): **TBD** The second section on financial options, which covers the pricing of equity options.
- [**#3.3: Options**](https://github.com/henrycosentino/quant_mentorship/blob/main/Lessons/3.3_options.ipynb): **TBD** The third section on financial options, which covers option volatility.
- [**#3.4: Options**](https://github.com/henrycosentino/quant_mentorship/blob/main/Lessons/3.4_options.ipynb): **TBD** The final section on financial options, which covers option Greeks.
- [**#4.1: Machine Learning**](https://github.com/henrycosentino/quant_mentorship/blob/main/Lessons/4.1_ml.ipynb): A lesson covering ordinary least squares, with an emphasis on the probability theory behind the model, the linear algebra used to implement it, and the statistical theory that helps us understand it.
