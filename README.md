# Overview
- The purpose of this repository was to hold the files for the mentee to access easily. The mentorship is multifaceted; however, one key aspect is understanding how Python can be applied in general and in the context of quantitative finance. Moreover, some lessons covering fundamental concepts in quantitative finance are demonstrated through Jupyter notebooks.

# Lessons
- [**#1: Introduction to Python**](https://github.com/henrycosentino/quant_mentorship/blob/main/Lessons/1_introduction.ipynb): focusing on the fundamentals of Python and object-oriented programming.
- [**#2: Iteration**](https://github.com/henrycosentino/quant_mentorship/blob/main/Lessons/2_iteration.ipynb): a lesson that focuses on iteration, with applications to functions (KNN algorithm) that can be implemented with iterative processes.
- [**#3: Classes**](https://github.com/henrycosentino/quant_mentorship/blob/main/Lessons/3_classes.ipynb): focuses on the basic tricks and techniques of classes in Python, with applications to Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithm implementation using Pythons class structure.
- [**#4: Functions**](https://github.com/henrycosentino/quant_mentorship/blob/main/Lessons/4_functions.ipynb): a lesson on lambda function, function arguments, higher order functions, and decorators.
- [**#5: Concurrency**](https://github.com/henrycosentino/quant_mentorship/blob/main/Lessons/5_concurrency.ipynb): a mini lesson on threading and the concurrent.futures library in Python.
- [**#6.1: Fixed Income**](https://github.com/henrycosentino/quant_mentorship/blob/main/Lessons/6.1_fixed_income.ipynb): first section of the analysis of fixed income securities. Covering topics involving the pricing structures of bonds, duration, convexity, yield-to-maturity, spot rates, and forward rates.
