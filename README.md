# Overview
The purpose of this repository is to provide a centralized location for mentorship materials. The mentorship is multifaceted, focusing on the application of Python in general programming and quantitative finance. Fundamental concepts in quantitative finance are demonstrated and explored through interactive Jupyter notebooks.

# Lessons

- [**#1.1: Python**](https://github.com/henrycosentino/quant_mentorship/blob/main/lessons/1.1_python.ipynb): A lesson focusing on the fundamentals of Python and the principles of object-oriented programming.
- [**#1.2: Python**](https://github.com/henrycosentino/quant_mentorship/blob/main/lessons/1.2_python.ipynb): A lesson focusing on iteration and its application to algorithms, such as the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, that can be implemented iteratively.
- [**#1.3: Python**](https://github.com/henrycosentino/quant_mentorship/blob/main/lessons/1.3_python.ipynb): A lesson focusing on Python classes, with applications to implementing Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithms using class structures.
- [**#1.4: Python**](https://github.com/henrycosentino/quant_mentorship/blob/main/lessons/1.4_python.ipynb): A lesson on lambda functions, function arguments, higher-order functions, and decorators.
- [**#1.5: Python**](https://github.com/henrycosentino/quant_mentorship/blob/main/lessons/1.5_python.ipynb): A mini-lesson on threading and the `concurrent.futures` library in Python.
- [**#2.1: Fixed Income**](https://github.com/henrycosentino/quant_mentorship/blob/main/lessons/2.1_fixed_income.ipynb): Part one of the fixed income securities analysis. Topics include bond pricing structures, duration, convexity, yield-to-maturity (YTM), spot rates, and forward rates.
- [**#2.2: Fixed Income**](https://github.com/henrycosentino/quant_mentorship/blob/main/lessons/2.2_fixed_income.ipynb): Part two of the fixed income securities analysis. This lesson focuses on bonds with embedded options, such as mortgages and callable bonds, and discusses the implications these options have on calculating duration, convexity, and spread.
- [**#2.3: Fixed Income**](https://github.com/henrycosentino/quant_mentorship/blob/main/lessons/2.3_fixed_income.ipynb): The final section of the fixed income securities analysis. This lesson focuses on interest rate futures and swap products.
- [**#3.1: Options**](https://github.com/henrycosentino/quant_mentorship/blob/main/lessons/3.1_options.ipynb): A lesson covering the probability theory relevant to options pricing in discrete-time.
- [**#3.2: Options**](https://github.com/henrycosentino/quant_mentorship/blob/main/lessons/3.2_options.ipynb): A lesson on pricing interest rate options within a discrete-time framework.
- [**#4.1: Machine Learning**](https://github.com/henrycosentino/quant_mentorship/blob/main/lessons/4.1_ml.ipynb): A lesson covering Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), with an emphasis on the underlying probability theory, the linear algebra required for implementation, and the statistical theory used for model interpretation.
