# Overview
- The purpose of this repository was to hold the files for the mentee to access easily. The mentorship is multifaceted; however, one aspect is understanding how Python and other programming languages can be used in general and in quantitative finance.

# Lessons
- [**#1: Introduction to Python**](https://github.com/henrycosentino/quant_mentorship/blob/main/Lessons/1_introduction.ipynb): focusing on the fundamentals of Python and object-oriented programming.
- [**#2: Iteration**](https://github.com/henrycosentino/quant_mentorship/blob/main/Lessons/2_iteration.ipynb): a lesson that focuses on iteration, with applications to functions (KNN algorithm) that can be implemented with iterative processes.
- [**#3: Classes**](https://github.com/henrycosentino/quant_mentorship/blob/main/Lessons/3_classes.ipynb): focuses on the basic tricks and techniques of classes in Python, with applications to Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithm implmenetation using Pythons class structure.
- [**#4: Functions**](https://github.com/henrycosentino/quant_mentorship/blob/main/Lessons/4_functions.ipynb): a lesson on lambda function, function arguments, higher order functions, and decorators.
- [**#5: Concurrency**](https://github.com/henrycosentino/quant_mentorship/blob/main/Lessons/5_concurrency.ipynb): a mini lesson on threading and the concurrent.futures library in Python.
- [**#6.1: Fixed Income**](https://github.com/henrycosentino/quant_mentorship/blob/main/Lessons/6.1_fixed_income.ipynb): first section of the analysis of fixed income securities. Covering topics involving the pricing structures of bonds, duration, convexity, yield-to-maturity, spot rates, and forward rates.
