    "\n",
    "        - Argues that a forward interest rate corresponding to a certain future period is equal to the expected future zero interest rate for that period\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Market Segmentation Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "        - The interest rate at a specific term (on the yield curve) is determined by supply and demand of bonds at that term\n",
    "\n",
    "        - For instance, the short-term interest rate is determined by supply and demand in the short-term bond market\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Liquidity Preference Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Investors prefer to preserve liquidity and invest funds for short periods of time. On the other hand, borrowers usually prefer to borrow at fixed rates for long periods of time\n",
    "\n",
    "        - This dynamic leads to a situation in which forward rates are greater than expected future zero rates\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cost of Carry\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Definition (general): The cost of carry is the expense associated with holding an asset over a period of time\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Definition (interest rate futures): The cost of carry for an interest rate future product is the interest paid on the margin account to hold the position, less any coupon payments received from holding the physical bond\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Mathematical Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Let $r$ be the repo rate and $y$ be the yield on the asset\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Then, the cost of carry, $c$, can be defined as: $$c = r - y$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "    - Positive Carry: The current yield of the asset being held is greater than the cost to finance it\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Negative Carry: The current yield of the asset being held is less than the cost to finance it\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - When $r < y$ the net cost of carry is negative (a benefit), and thus it costs less to hold the asset than finance the asset. Meaning you make money holding the asset.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - When $r > y$ the net cost of carry is positive (a cost), and thus it costs more to hold the asset than finance the asset. Meaning you lose money holding the asset.\n",

    "        - Let \n",
    "            - $V_f$ be the price of an interest rate futures contract\n",
    "            - $D_f$ be the duration of the asset underlying the futures contract at the maturity of the futures contract\n",
    "            - $P$ be the forward value of the portfolio being hedged at the maturity of the hedge (usually assumed to be the portfolio's current value)\n",
    "            - $D_p$ be the duration of the portfolio at the maturity of the hedge\n",
    "            - $\\Delta y$ be the change in the forward yield\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Then, the change in the portfolio's value can be expressed as: $$\\Delta P = -P \\cdot D_p \\cdot \\Delta y$$\n",

The manager decides to use the September T-bond futures contract to hedge the portfolio's exposure to interest rate risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "            - The current futures price is quoted at 96'08. Each contract represents the delivery of a bond with a $100,000 face value.\n",

    "            - It is projected that the duration of the $25 million bond portfolio in 6 months will be 7.50 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "            - The bond expected to be cheapest-to-deliver for the September contract is a 25-year 4.00% per annum coupon bond. The current yield on this bond is 4.25% per annum, and its duration at the maturity of the futures contract is calculated to be 10.40 years.\n",
